## Summary 
TechFlow Solutions is a B2B software company founded in 2019 that provides workflow automation tools for mid-sized enterprises. The company has raised $12M in Series A funding and currently serves over 250 clients across North America and Europe. With a team of 45 employees based in Austin, Texas, TechFlow has demonstrated 180% year-over-year growth and maintains a 94% customer retention rate.


## Team
The founding team brings diverse experience from leading tech companies. CEO Sarah Martinez previously led product development at Salesforce for 8 years, while CTO James Chen was an early engineer at Dropbox. CFO Michael Rodriguez has 15 years of experience in SaaS finance, having served as VP of Finance at HubSpot. The executive team is supported by experienced heads of engineering, sales, and customer success, each with 10+ years in their respective fields.



## Problem
Mid-sized companies struggle with fragmented workflows across multiple software platforms, leading to inefficiencies, data silos, and employee frustration. Manual data entry between systems consumes an average of 12 hours per employee per week, while integration costs with traditional enterprise software can exceed $100K annually. Existing solutions are either too expensive and complex for mid-market companies or too simplistic to handle sophisticated business processes.



## Product

Users can build custom workflows in minutes without technical expertise, using pre-built templates for common business processes. The platform includes real-time analytics, collaborative workflow design, and enterprise-grade security features. Key differentiators include AI-powered workflow suggestions and a flexible pricing model that scales with usage.


## Outcome
Since launching commercially in 2020, TechFlow has helped clients save an average of 15 hours per employee per week and reduce software integration costs by 60%. Customer surveys indicate a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating, with customers reporting improved team productivity and reduced operational costs. The company projects reaching profitability by Q3 2024 and plans to expand into Asian markets in 2025.
